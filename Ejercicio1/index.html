    <p>
        The Spain national football team represents Spain in men's International association football and is controlled
        by the Royal Spanish Football Federation, the governing body for football in Spain. The current head coach is
        Julen Lopetegui after Vicente del Bosque stepped down following Euro 2016.[5] The Spanish side is commonly
        referred to as La Roja ("The Red [One]"), La Furia Roja ("The Red Fury"), La Furia Española ("The Spanish Fury")
        or simply La Furia ("The Fury").
        Spain became a member of FIFA in 1904 even though the Spanish Football Federation was first established in 1909.
        Spain's national team debuted in 1920. Since then, the Spanish national team has participated in a total of 14
        of 20 FIFA World Cups and 9 of 14 UEFA European Championships.

    <h3>History</h3>

    <p>
        The first Spain national football team was constituted in 1920, with the main objective of finding a team that
        would represent Spain at the Summer Olympics held in Belgium in that same year. Spain made their debut at the
        tournament on 28 August 1920 against Denmark, silver medallists at the last two Olympic tournaments. The Spanish
        managed to win that match by a scoreline of 1–0, eventually finishing with the silver medal. Spain qualified for
        their first FIFA World Cup in 1934, defeating Brazil in their first game and losing in a replay to the hosts and
        eventual champions Italy in the quarter-finals.
        The Spanish Civil War and World War II prevented Spain from playing any competitive matches between the 1934
        World Cup and the 1950 edition's qualifiers. At the 1950 finals in Brazil, they topped their group to progress
        to the final round, then finished in fourth place. Until 2010, this had been Spain's highest finish in a FIFA
        World Cup finals, which had given them the name of the "underachievers".

    <h3>Home stadium</h3>

    <p>Spain does not have a designated national stadium, and as such, major qualifying matches are usually played at
        the
        Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid. Other large grounds used include the Vicente Calderón Stadium, also in
        Madrid,
        and the Mestalla in Valencia. Spain is unbeaten in competitive matches played at the Calderón. Some
        international
        friendlies are played in these larger stadia, as well as the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium in Seville.

        Barcelona, the second largest city in Spain has not hosted an international match with Spain playing since 2004
        (held at the Montjuic Olympic Stadium), and the largest stadium in Spain and Europe, the Camp Nou has not hosted
        an
        international match with Spain playing since 1987.
